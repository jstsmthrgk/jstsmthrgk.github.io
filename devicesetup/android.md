## Android

First of all you'll have to decide if you want to install F-Droid.

F-Droid is an alternative appstore, which only contains FOSS apps.
Amongst other things FOSS means that everybody can see the source code and see exactly what the app does.
Most of these apps are also aviable in the Google Play Store, but I do recommend installing F-Droid, because you can generally trust apps from F-Droid more than apps from the Google Play Store.
