## Game Counter

Counter is a simple app to keep track of points during a game.

### Download

You can [download](https://github.com/jstsmthrgk/counter/releases) counter from the [Github release page](https://github.com/jstsmthrgk/counter/releases). The pre-release versions are safe to use!

I do not provide it in the Google Play Store because I do not want to pay the 20$ developer fee. Thus you have to turn on apps from unknown sources in order to install this app.

### Usage

Just tap on new game and choose your game parameters:

- Unit: every value displayed will be multiplied by this
- Initial: the starting points of every player
- Players: how many players you have
