<h2>What is this website all about?</h2>
<p>I just wanted to make a better website than <a href="https://woegingerelias.azurewebsites.net">Elias WÃ¶ginger</a>, that's it.</p>
<h2>But you don't have any memes here?!?</h2>
<p>That's  the point, if you want memes visit <a href="https://reddit.com/r/linuxmemes">r/linuxmemes</a>.</p>
<h2>At least this is a real website?</h2>
<p>Of course it is, it even passes the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjstsmthrgk.github.io%2F">W3C Validator Check</a>.</p>
