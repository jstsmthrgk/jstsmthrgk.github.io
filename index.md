## What is this website all about?
I just wanted to make a better website than [Elias WÃ¶ginger](https://woegingerelias.azurewebsites.net), that's it.
## But you don't have any memes here?!?
That's  the point, if you want memes visit [r/linuxmemes](https://reddit.com/r/linuxmemes).
## At least this is a real website?
Of course it is, it even passes the [W3C Validator Check](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjstsmthrgk.github.io%2F).
